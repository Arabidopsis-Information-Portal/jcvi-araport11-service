# Araport11 Webservices

These are [Araport](http://www.araport.org) services that can parse Araport11 GFF3 files, extract information (including features), and convert them into a JSON format.

## araport11_to_json
Given a valid AGI locus return it's features from the Araport11 Pre-Release 2 (10/2015) annotation in JSON format consumable by the jBrowse genome browser. This service uses ThaleMine to retrieve chromosome location information and the araport11_gff_to_jbrowse service to extract the features.
